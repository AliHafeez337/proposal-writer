We're looking for a reliable developer to support me with a Next.js-based monorepo project that has grown over time and now needs some regular care. The codebase includes:
• Two separate Next.js 15 applications (built with TypeScript)
• A few internal shared packages (think: utilities, database access, auth logic, etc.)
• Infrastructure defined in code using AWS CDK (TypeScript)
• Tooling managed via Turborepo and npm workspaces

This project is functional and actively used, but since it’s evolved quite a bit, it’s not trivial to jump into without context. I’ll provide documentation, an onboarding video, and direct access to ask questions.

What I need from you:

On-demand development support, such as:
• Implementing small features in the apps (e.g. new UI components, API routes, user flows)
• Fixing occasional bugs (especially when they’re buried in shared packages)
• Adjusting or extending the CDK infrastructure (e.g. adding a new Lambda, tweaking IAM roles, or setting up a new S3 bucket)

Ideal experience:
• Solid knowledge of Next.js and modern React
• Familiarity with TypeScript in monorepo environments
• Experience working with AWS CDK and a good understanding of AWS services (Lambda, API Gateway, S3, etc.)
• Comfortable with Turborepo and workspaces (or willing to learn quickly)
• Good communication and ability to work independently (I’ll give you tasks and context, but I don’t want to micromanage)

How we’ll work together:
This is a long-term, part-time collaboration. I’ll assign tasks occasionally — sometimes it’s a quick fix, other times it might be a new feature. You should be comfortable:
• Cloning and running a monorepo locally
• Reviewing and understanding existing code before jumping in
• Delivering clean, testable code via PRs
• Communicating transparently if something is unclear

If this sounds like something you could help with, please apply with a short message:
• Mention any relevant experience with monorepos and CDK
• Bonus points if you can share code samples or projects you’ve worked on

Looking forward to hearing from you!
